This EDA is my first Python project. By utilizing and cleansing a dataset found on Kaggle, which encompasses different people's age, gender, social media platform they usually use, daily usage time, number of messages sent, posts made, likes and comments received per day, as well as their daily dominant emotions, I have made several matplotlib graphs:
1. A side-by-side bar chart comparing how emotions vary across different platforms and usage time respectively

![Emotion Count on Different Usage Time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26da2072-bb76-49f0-bda1-aa9a9de8fa24)
2. Bar charts showing the trends of emotions within the lower and upper quartiles of people in terms of likes received

3. Histograms of daily usage in different platforms

4. A heatmap comparing the correlations of quantitative metrics above.

By analyzing these graphs, I have come to figure out some assumptions we made about social media are actually wrong, like people who spend more time on social media are more unhappy, which has turned out to be false. The full report can be viewed here:
